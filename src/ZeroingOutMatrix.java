    * Our startup is building a data analytics dashboard that relies on a matrix to display data.
    * Unfortunately, some of the data points are missing or have been corrupted and are represented by a 0 in
    * the matrix. This creates a lot of confusion for our users and can lead to incorrect analysis. We need your
    * help to implement a function that sets the entire row and column to 0's if a data point is missing or corrupted.
    * Bonus: Do not use any extra memory

    /*
    * Our startup is building a data analytics dashboard that relies on a matrix to display data.
    * Unfortunately, some of the data points are missing or have been corrupted and are represented by a 0 in
    * the matrix. This creates a lot of confusion for our users and can lead to incorrect analysis. We need your
    * help to implement a function that sets the entire row and column to 0's if a data point is missing or corrupted.
    * Bonus: Do not use any extra memory
    *
    * Example 1:
    *
    *   matrix = {{0, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 0}};
    *   Output = {{0, 0, 0}, {4, 5, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 0, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    *   Output = {{1, 0, 3}, {0, 0, 0}, {7, 0, 9}}
    *

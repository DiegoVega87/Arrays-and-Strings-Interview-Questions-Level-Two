    * Your startup has a large inventory of products with their respective prices stored in an integer array
    * called ""products"". You want to identify all possible combinations of three products that can be sold
    * together such that the total revenue generated is equal to $1000. Write a function that takes in the array
    * of products and returns a list of all unique triplets satisfying the conditions mentioned above. Note that
    * each product can only be used once in a triplet.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   int[] products = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600};
    *   Output: [[100, 200, 700], [100, 300, 600], [100, 400, 500], [200, 300, 500]]
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   int[] products = {50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500};
    *   Output: [[50, 200, 750], [50, 250, 700], [50, 300, 650], [50, 350, 600], [50, 400, 550],
    *   [100, 150, 750], [100, 200, 700], [100, 250, 650], [100, 300, 600], [100, 350, 550],
    *   [150, 200, 650], [150, 250, 600], [150, 300, 550], [200, 250, 550]]

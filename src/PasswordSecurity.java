    * In order to provide the user with information about the password's strength, we aim to notify them about
    * the longest substring within the password that does not contain any repeated characters. To achieve this,
    * we require a function that takes a password string as input and returns the length of the longest substring
    * without any repeated characters.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   String password = "abcabcbb";
    *   expectedOutput = 3;
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   String password = "bbbbb";
    *   int expectedOutput = 1;

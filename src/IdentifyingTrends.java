    /*
    * Your startup is looking to invest in the stock market and you want to find a way to identify potential
    * opportunities for profit. You have historical data of daily stock prices in an integer array called prices.
    * Write a function that returns true if there exists a triplet of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and
    * prices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k]. This indicates that there is an increasing trend in the stock prices
    * and investing in this sequence could lead to profit. If no such indices exists, return false.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   Input: prices = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    *   Output: true
    *   Explanation: There exists a triplet (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and prices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k].
    *   For example, (0, 1, 2) or (1, 2, 3) or (2, 3, 4).
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   Input: prices = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
    *   Output: false
    *   Explanation: There is no triplet (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and prices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k].
